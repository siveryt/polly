> Polly is a Discord-Bot designed for a better experience with Polls

Many Discord-Sevrer nowadays use Polls to interact with their community, but usually these endup in Messages and Readtions attached to them and no time limit. Polly solves this Issue with Button and Time-restricted polls.
The many options give you the opportunity to customize your polls to your needs
